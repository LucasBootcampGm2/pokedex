# Pokémon Explorer

This project is a web application that allows users to explore and view information about Pokémon using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Users can search by name, filter by type, navigate between pages, and view specific details about each Pokémon with a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

## Features

1. **Fetch Pokémon from PokeAPI**: Pokémon are fetched from the API and displayed on the homepage.
2. **Filter by Name**: You can search for Pokémon by their name.
3. **Filter by Type**: Users can filter Pokémon based on their type (water, fire, etc.).
4. **Card Rotation**: Each Pokémon card can be flipped to show its complete stats (health, attack, defense, etc.).
5. **Max Pokémon per Page**: The application allows setting a maximum number of Pokémon per page.
6. **Pagination**: Includes buttons to navigate between pages (previous and next).
7. **Individual Pokémon Page**: Clicking on a Pokémon redirects to a dedicated page showing more detailed information.
8. **Individual CSS for Each Pokémon Page**: Each Pokémon page has its own CSS style.
9. **Loading Indicator**: The homepage includes a loading spinner while data is being fetched from the API.
10. **Error Handling**: An error handler is implemented to manage issues when fetching data from the API.
11. **CSS Fixes**: Adjustments and corrections in the page's design to ensure visual appeal.
12. **Import Fixes**: Solutions to import-related issues in the project.
13. **JavaScript Bug Fixes**: Fixes to the JavaScript code impacting app functionality.
